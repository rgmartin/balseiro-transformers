## Introduction
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a deep learning framework, one of the two main frameworks alongside [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The installation can be done via Pip or Conda, as described [here](https://pytorch.org/). Let's start by importing PyTorch:

##Part 1: Tensors

**Tensors** are PyTorch's most basic building block. Each tensor is a multi-dimensional matrix; for example, a 256x256 square image might be represented by a `3x256x256` tensor, where the first dimension represents color. Here's how to create a tensor:
"""

# Initializing a tensor
data = torch.tensor([
                     [0, 1],
                     [2, 3],
                     [4, 5]
                    ])
print(data)

"""Each tensor has a **data type**: the major data types you'll need to worry about are floats (`torch.float32`) and integers (`torch.int`). You can specify the data type explicitly when you create the tensor:"""

# Initializing a tensor with an explicit data type
# Notice the dots after the numbers, which specify that they're floats
data = torch.tensor([
                     [0, 1],
                     [2, 3],
                     [4, 5]
                    ], dtype=torch.float32)

print("The product is", a.matmul(b)) #(3, 4)
print("The other product is", a @ b) # +, -, *, @

print("The contents are currently", rr)
print()
rr = rr.view(5, 3)

import numpy as np

# numpy.ndarray --> torch.Tensor:
arr = np.array([[1, 0, 5]])

## Autograd
Pytorch is well-known for its automatic differentiation feature. We can call the `backward()` method to ask `PyTorch` to calculate the gradients, which are then stored in the `grad` attribute.
"""

# Create an example tensor
# requires_grad parameter tells PyTorch to store gradients
x = torch.tensor([2.], requires_grad=True)

# Print the gradient if it is calculated
# Currently None since x is a scalar
pp.pprint(x.grad)

# Calculating the gradient of y with respect to x
y = x * x * 3 # 3x^2
y.backward()
pp.pprint(x.grad) # d(y)/d(x) = d(3x^2)/d(x) = 6x = 12

"""Let's run backprop from a different tensor again to see what happens."""

z = x * x * 3 # 3x^2

z = x * x * 3 # 3x^2
z.backward()
# y = x * x * 3
pp.pprint(x.grad)

z = x * x * 3 # 3x^2
z.backward()
# y = x * x * 3
pp.pprint(x.grad)

"""We can see that the `x.grad` is updated to be the sum of the gradients calculated so far. When we run backprop in a neural network, we sum up all the gradients for a particular neuron before making an update. This is exactly what is happening here! This is also the reason why we need to run `zero_grad()` in every training iteration (more on this later). Otherwise our gradients would keep building up from one training iteration to the other, which would cause our updates to be wrong.

## Customized Backward Function
In some rare cases, you might want to design your own operators, or calculate higher order gradients that are not supported by Pytorch. In these cases you can define your own function with customized forward & backward computation. However, keep in mind that always check if something is already implemented by Pytorch (which is very likely) before customizing your own forward & backward computation. See more at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html.

## Neural Network Module

So far we have looked into the tensors, their properties and basic operations on tensors. These are especially useful to get familiar with if we are building the layers of our network from scratch. We will utilize these in Assignment 2, but moving forward, we will use predefined blocks in the `torch.nn` module of `PyTorch`. We will then put together these blocks to create complex networks. Let's start by importing this module with an alias so that we don't have to type `torch` every time we use it.
"""

import torch.nn as nn

"""### **Linear Layer**
We can use `nn.Linear(H_in, H_out)` to create a a linear layer. This will take a matrix of `(N, *, H_in)` dimensions and output a matrix of `(N, *, H_out)`. The `*` denotes that there could be arbitrary number of dimensions in between. The linear layer performs the operation `Ax+b`, where `A` and `b` are initialized randomly. If we don't want the linear layer to learn the bias parameters, we can initialize our layer with `bias=False`.
"""

# Create the inputs
input = torch.ones(2,3,4)
# N* H_in -> N*H_out


# Make a linear layers transforming N,*,H_in dimensinal inputs to N,*,H_out
# dimensional outputs
linear = nn.Linear(4, 2)
linear_output = linear(input)

linear_output.shape

list(linear.parameters()) # Ax + b

# Data of shape [batch_size, feature_dim] # 4
# [batch_size, output_dim] # 2

# linear layer of shape (feature_dim, output_dim)

"""### **Other Module Layers**
There are several other preconfigured layers in the `nn` module. Some commonly used examples are `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.ConvTranspose2d`, `nn.BatchNorm1d`, `nn.BatchNorm2d`, `nn.Upsample` and `nn.MaxPool2d` among many others. We will learn more about these as we progress in the course. For now, the only important thing to remember is that we can treat each of these layers as plug and play components: we will be providing the required dimensions and `PyTorch` will take care of setting them up.

### **Activation Function Layer**
We can also use the `nn` module to apply activations functions to our tensors. Activation functions are used to add non-linearity to our network. Some examples of activations functions are `nn.ReLU()`, `nn.Sigmoid()` and `nn.LeakyReLU()`. Activation functions operate on each element seperately, so the shape of the tensors we get as an output are the same as the ones we pass in.
"""

linear_output

sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
output = sigmoid(linear_output)
output

"""### **Putting the Layers Together**
So far we have seen that we can create layers and pass the output of one as the input of the next. Instead of creating intermediate tensors and passing them around, we can use `nn.Sequentual`, which does exactly that.
"""

    nn.Linear(4, 2),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)

input = torch.ones(2,3,4)
output = block(input)

"""### Custom Modules

Instead of using the predefined modules, we can also build our own by extending the `nn.Module` class. For example, we can build a the `nn.Linear` (which also extends `nn.Module`) on our own using the tensor introduced earlier! We can also build new, more complex modules, such as a custom neural network. You will be practicing these in the later assignment.

To create a custom module, the first thing we have to do is to extend the `nn.Module`. We can then initialize our parameters in the `__init__` function, starting with a call to the `__init__` function of the super class. All the class attributes we define which are `nn` module objects are treated as parameters, which can be learned during the training. Tensors are not parameters, but they can be turned into parameters if they are wrapped in `nn.Parameter` class.

All classes extending `nn.Module` are also expected to implement a `forward(x)` function, where `x` is a tensor. This is the function that is called when a parameter is passed to our module, such as in `model(x)`.

Some popular examples are `optim.SGD` and `optim.Adam`. When initializing optimizers, we pass our model parameters, which can be accessed with `model.parameters()`, telling the optimizers which values it will be optimizing. Optimizers also has a learning rate (`lr`) parameter, which determines how big of an update will be made in every step. Different optimizers have different hyperparameters as well.

## Demo: Word Window Classification

Until this part of the notebook, we have learned the fundamentals of PyTorch and built a basic network solving a toy task. Now we will attempt to solve an example NLP task. Here are the things we will learn:

1. Data: Creating a Dataset of Batched Tensors
2. Modeling
3. Training
4. Prediction

In this section, our goal will be to train a model that will find the words in a sentence corresponding to a `LOCATION`, which will be always of span `1` (meaning that `San Fransisco` won't be recognized as a `LOCATION`). Our task is called `Word Window Classification` for a reason. Instead of letting our model to only take a look at one word in each forward pass, we would like it to be able to consider the context of the word in question. That is, for each word, we want our model to be aware of the surrounding words. Let's dive in!

### Data

The very first task of any machine learning project is to set up our training set. Usually, there will be a training corpus we will be utilizing. In NLP tasks, the corpus would generally be a `.txt` or `.csv` file where each row corresponds to a sentence or a tabular datapoint. In our toy task, we will assume that we have already read our data and the corresponding labels into a `Python` list.
"""

# Our raw data, which consists of sentences
corpus = [
          "We always come to Paris",
          "The professor is from Australia",
          "I live in Stanford",
          "He comes from Taiwan",
          "The capital of Turkey is Ankara"
         ]

"""#### Preprocessing

To make it easier for our models to learn, we usually apply a few preprocessing steps to our data. This is especially important when dealing with text data. Here are some examples of text preprocessing:
* **Tokenization**: Tokenizing the sentences into words.
* **Lowercasing**: Changing all the letters to be lowercase.
* **Noise removal:** Removing special characters (such as punctuations).
* **Stop words removal**: Removing commonly used words.

Which preprocessing steps are necessary is determined by the task at hand. For example, although it is useful to remove special characters in some tasks, for others they may be important (for example, if we are dealing with multiple languages). For our task, we will lowercase our words and tokenize.

"""

# The preprocessing function we will use to generate our training examples
# Our function is a simple one, we lowercase the letters
# and then tokenize the words.
def preprocess_sentence(sentence):
  return sentence.lower().split()

# Create our training set
train_sentences = [preprocess_sentence(sent) for sent in corpus]
train_sentences

"""For each training example we have, we should also have a corresponding label. Recall that the goal of our model was to determine which words correspond to a `LOCATION`. That is, we want our model to output `0` for all the words that are not `LOCATION`s and `1` for the ones that are `LOCATION`s."""

# Set of locations that appear in our corpus
locations = set(["australia", "ankara", "paris", "stanford", "taiwan", "turkey"])

# Our train labels
train_labels = [[1 if word in locations else 0 for word in sent] for sent in train_sentences]
train_labels

"""#### Converting Words to Embeddings

Let's look at our training data a little more closely. Each datapoint we have is a sequence of words. On the other hand, we know that machine learning models work with numbers in vectors. How are we going to turn words into numbers? You may be thinking embeddings and you are right!

Imagine that we have an embedding lookup table `E`, where each row corresponds to an embedding. That is, each word in our vocabulary would have a corresponding embedding row `i` in this table. Whenever we want to find an embedding for a word, we will follow these steps:
1. Find the corresponding index `i` of the word in the embedding table: `word->index`.
2. Index into the embedding table and get the embedding: `index->embedding`.

Let's look at the first step. We should assign all the words in our vocabulary to a corresponding index. We can do it as follows:
1. Find all the unique words in our corpus.
2. Assign an index to each.
"""

# Find all the unique words in our corpus
vocabulary = set(w for s in train_sentences for w in s)
vocabulary

"""`vocabulary` now contains all the words in our corpus. On the other hand, during the test time, we can see words that are not contained in our vocabulary. If we can figure out a way to represent the unknown words, our model can still reason about whether they are a `LOCATION` or not, since we are also looking at the neighboring words for each prediction.

We introduce a special token, `<unk>`, to tackle the words that are out of vocabulary. We could pick another string for our unknown token if we wanted. The only requirement here is that our token should be unique: we should only be using this token for unknown words. We will also add this special token to our vocabulary.
"""

# Add the unknown token to our vocabulary
vocabulary.add("<unk>")

"""Earlier we mentioned that our task was called `Word Window Classification` because our model is looking at the surroundings words in addition to the given word when it needs to make a prediction.

For example, let's take the sentence "We always come to Paris". The corresponding training label for this sentence is `0, 0, 0, 0, 1` since only Paris, the last word, is a `LOCATION`. In one pass (meaning a call to `forward()`), our model will try to generate the correct label for one word. Let's say our model is trying to generate the correct label `1` for `Paris`. If we only allow our model to see `Paris`, but nothing else, we will miss out on the important information that the word `to` often times appears with `LOCATION`s.

Word windows allow our model to consider the surrounding `+N` or `-N` words of each word when making a prediction. In our earlier example for `Paris`, if we have a window size of 1, that means our model will look at the words that come immediately before and after `Paris`, which are `to`, and, well, nothing. Now, this raises another issue. `Paris` is at the end of our sentence, so there isn't another word following it. Remember that we define the input dimensions of our `PyTorch` models when we are initializing them. If we set the window size to be `1`, it means that our model will be accepting `3` words in every pass. We cannot have our model expect `2` words from time to time.

The solution is to introduce a special token, such as `<pad>`, that will be added to our sentences to make sure that every word has a valid window around them. Similar to `<unk>` token, we could pick another string for our pad token if we wanted, as long as we make sure it is used for a unique purpose.

#### Batching Sentences

We have learned about batches in class. Waiting our whole training corpus to be processed before making an update is constly. On the other hand, updating the parameters after every training example causes the loss to be less stable between updates. To combat these issues, we instead update our parameters after training on a batch of data. This allows us to get a better estimate of the gradient of the global loss. In this section, we will learn how to structure our data into batches using the `torch.util.data.DataLoader` class.

We will be calling the `DataLoader` class as follows: `DataLoader(data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)`.  The `batch_size` parameter determines the number of examples per batch. In every epoch, we will be iterating over all the batches using the `DataLoader`. The order of batches is deterministic by default, but we can ask `DataLoader` to shuffle the batches by setting the `shuffle` parameter to `True`. This way we ensure that we don't encounter a bad batch multiple times.

If provided, `DataLoader` passes the batches it prepares to the `collate_fn`. We can write a custom function to pass to the `collate_fn` parameter in order to print stats about our batch or perform extra processing. In our case, we will use the `collate_fn` to:
1. Window pad our train sentences.
2. Convert the words in the training examples to indices.
3. Pad the training examples so that all the sentences and labels have the same length. Similarly, we also need to pad the labels. This creates an issue because when calculating the loss, we need to know the actual number of words in a given example. We will also keep track of this number in the function we pass to the `collate_fn` parameter.

Because our version of the `collate_fn` function will need to access to our `word_to_ix` dictionary (so that it can turn words into indices), we will make use of the `partial` function in `Python`, which passes the parameters we give to the function we pass it.

The way our input tensors are currently formatted, we have all the words in a sentence in one datapoint. When we pass this input to our model, it needs to create the windows for each word, make a prediction as to whether the center word is a `LOCATION` or not for each window, put the predictions together and return.

We could avoid this problem if we formatted our data by breaking it into windows beforehand. In this example, we will instead how our model take care of the formatting.

Given that our `window_size` is `N` we want our model to make a prediction on every `2N+1` tokens. That is, if we have an input with `9` tokens, and a `window_size` of `2`, we want our model to return `5` predictions. This makes sense because before we padded it with `2` tokens on each side, our input also had `5` tokens in it!

We can create these windows by using for loops, but there is a faster `PyTorch` alternative, which is the `unfold(dimension, size, step)` method. We can create the windows we need using this method as follows:
